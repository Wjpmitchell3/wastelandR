 A few R functions to improve gameplay for [Modiphius's Fallout RPG](https://www.modiphius.net/pages/falloutrpg).

## Player Sheets
My time playing other tabletop games has always been better when I've had an electronic copy of the player sheet that was easily managed and interactive, so that's what I've done with the official player sheets provided by Modiphius using Adobe Acrobat DC. Please note I did not create these sheets and reproducing these for non-personal use is strictly prohibited, as noted by Modiphius at the bottom of the page. I simply altered the sheets to make playing with friends remotely on a computer, or even in-person with friends, more convenient.
